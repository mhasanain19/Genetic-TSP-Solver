# Genetic-TSP-Solver 
This project demonstrates how to solve the **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** implemented in Python. The TSP is a classic optimization problem in which the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting point.
